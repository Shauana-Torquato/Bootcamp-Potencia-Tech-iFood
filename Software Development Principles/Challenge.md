<h4>Module Challenge</h4>
<p>
    Contribute to the "Community" directory by creating a Profile README containing information about yourself that you want to share with the community.

<p>
    For this, you can insert: badges indicating your skills; cards with your GitHub stats and projects you've created, collaborated on, or want others to collaborate on.</p>
   
<p>
     In addition, you can also link to your project challenges and articles on the Digital Innovation One platform.</p>

<p>
     Get inspired by consulting the examples in the community folder, check out some utilities in the utils folder and use your creativity to create your own</p>

<h4>Instructions</h4>

<ol>

<li>Fork the repository;</li>

<li>Clone locally: git clone https://github.com/SEUUSERNAME/dio-lab-open-source.git;</li>

<li>Add upstream remote to keep your local repository up to date: git remote add upstream https://github.com/elidianaandrade/dio-lab-open-source.git;
<p><br>
Use the command git pull upstream main to download and merge changes to your local repository based on the branch main from this original repository you forked it from, or git fetch upstream main to download without merging. See more at: Getting Started with Git and GitHub.</p></br></li>
<li>Create a new branch and name it as feat/community/seunomedeusuario: git checkout -b feat/community/yourusername;
Example: git checkout -b feat/community/elidianaandrade</li>
<li>
Inside the folder community, create a file in Markdown (extension .md) and name it the same as your GitHub username;
Example: elidianaandrade.md</li>
<li>
Develop your profile. For this you can see examples in the folder community and add some of the utilities present in the folder utils;
Note: Use the other examples as inspiration, not copy.</li>
<li>
Add your changes to the "staging area" with the command git add community/yourusername.md;</li>
<li>
Create a commit and add the message indicating the addition of your profile git commit -m"feat: add yourusername profile";</li>
<li>
